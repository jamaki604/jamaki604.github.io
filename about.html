            <h1>Hey There! I’m Jacob King.</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I’m a software engineer and founder who recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Ball State University. I enjoy building scalable software, launching real products, and blending technical problem-solving with strong communication and leadership.
            </p>

            <h2>What's My Story?</h2>
            <p>
                I earned my Bachelor’s in Computer Science in May 2025 with a GPA of 3.0 / 4.0. Since then, I’ve continued growing as a developer by building and launching production software, including founding and operating my own SaaS product, GUNDEX.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="skills">
            <h2>What Can I Do?</h2>
            <p>I’ve worked across the full stack and mobile ecosystem, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Languages:</strong> TypeScript, JavaScript, Dart, Python, SQL, Java, HTML, CSS, C</li>
                <li><strong>Web & Mobile:</strong> Flutter, React, Node.js, Express, REST APIs, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap</li>
                <li><strong>Backend & Cloud:</strong> Supabase, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, Row Level Security (RLS), Edge Functions, Cloud Storage</li>
                <li><strong>Platforms & Tools:</strong> Git/GitHub, Vercel, Android Studio, Xcode, IntelliJ, VS Code</li>
                <li><strong>Practices:</strong> CI/CD, Agile Development, Clean Architecture, Secure API Design, SaaS Architecture</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I enjoy building products end-to-end — from clean, intuitive interfaces to secure, scalable backend systems — especially when those products solve real problems for real users.
            </p>

            <h2>Projects I’ve Rocked</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>GUNDEX (Founder & Lead Software Engineer):</strong>
                I founded and built GUNDEX, a production mobile SaaS platform for Gundam Trading Card Game collectors. I designed and deployed a cross-platform Flutter app on iOS and Android, architected a scalable Supabase/PostgreSQL backend, implemented automated data ingestion pipelines, and launched a freemium subscription model. The platform has grown to 500+ users organically through community-driven development.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>UI Web Builder:</strong>
                As the principal software developer and team lead, I created a drag-and-drop website builder enabling real-time customization of modular components. Built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Prisma ORM, and Supabase, with authentication and deployment handled via Vercel.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Spotify Search Engine:</strong>
                One of my earlier collaborative projects where I led development of a clean, user-focused search interface using the Spotify API and Flutter/Dart. This project strengthened my skills in API integration, UI design, and team collaboration.
            </p>

        <section id="experience">
            <h2>Where I've Been</h2>
            <p>
                My journey has blended leadership, technology, and people-focused work. I’ve managed teams in the U.S. Navy, worked in consultative B2B technology roles, led retail operations at Verizon, and now operate my own software company.
            </p>
            <p>
                Across all of it, I’ve focused on solving problems, improving systems, and helping teams and users succeed.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="off-the-clock">
            <h2>Off the Clock</h2>
            <p>
                Life at home is full and rewarding, shared with my wife Nataleigh, our three-year-old son Asher, four dogs, and two cats. Being a father is the most meaningful role I’ve ever had, and it’s shaped how I approach responsibility, time management, and growth. Outside of family life, I enjoy riding motorcycles, creating music, filming and photography, and spending time outdoors.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="lets-talk">
            <h2>Why We Should Talk</h2>
            <p>
                My time in the Navy shaped my resilience, discipline, and leadership under pressure. While an injury redirected my path, the lessons stuck — ownership, accountability, and follow-through.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I bring that mindset into software engineering and product development. I take responsibility seriously and look for roles where I can contribute meaningfully, grow continuously, and be trusted to deliver.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're looking for someone who blends technical execution with leadership, humility, and drive, I’d welcome the conversation.
