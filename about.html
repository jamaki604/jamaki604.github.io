        <h1>Hey There! I’m Jacob King.</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Ball State University and continue blending tech with my knack for connecting with people. Think of me as part geek, part people-person, all rolled into one.</p>
    </header>
    
    <section id="my-story">
        <h2>What's My Story?</h2>
        <p>Well, I’m glad you asked! I earned my Bachelor’s in Computer Science in May 2025 with a GPA of 3.0 / 4.0. It’s been a journey full of growth, challenge, and lots of code — and I’m just getting started.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="skills">
        <h2>What Can I Do?</h2>
        <p>I’ve worked with a wide range of tools and technologies, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Languages: TypeScript, Java, Dart, JavaScript, Python, SQL, C, Assembly</li>
            <li>Frameworks & Tools: React, Node.js, Express, Flutter, Prisma ORM, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap</li>
            <li>Platforms: Git/GitHub, Vercel, Clerk Auth, IntelliJ, Android Studio, VS Code, MySQL Workbench</li>
            <li>Practices: CI/CD, Agile, Clean Code, Version Control</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I enjoy building both beautiful front-ends and robust, scalable back-ends. I'm especially drawn to projects that combine performance, usability, and purpose.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="projects">
        <h2>Projects I’ve Rocked</h2>
        <p><strong>UI Web Builder:</strong> As the principal software developer and team lead, I created a drag-and-drop website builder that allows real-time customization of modular components. Built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Prisma, and Supabase. I also implemented Clerk for authentication and deployed the project to Vercel.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Spotify Search Engine:</strong> One of my first collaborative projects. I led development of a sleek, user-friendly search interface using the Spotify API and Flutter/Dart. This project sharpened my skills in API integration, team collaboration, and front-end design.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="experience">
        <h2>Where I've Been</h2>
        <p>My journey’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. From managing teams in the Navy and navigating the high seas of B2B sales at Impact Networking to steering the ship at Verizon Wireless, it's all been about making meaningful connections and finding solutions that matter.</p>
        <p>And why sales, you ask? It’s simple. There’s something powerful about helping someone find exactly what they need. Plus, making people smile is kind of my thing.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="off-the-clock">
        <h2>Off the Clock</h2>
        <p>Life at home is a bustling, heartwarming affair, filled with love from my four dogs, two cats, and most importantly, my two-year-old son, Asher. Asher has brought an indescribable joy into our lives, making every moment precious. Being a father is undoubtedly the best thing that has ever happened to me. My wife, Nataleigh, and I cherish the laughter, love, and even the chaos that comes with our little big family. When I'm not basking in the joys of family life, you might find me riding motorcycles, creating tunes, capturing life’s moments through film and photography, or exploring the outdoors. That balance between family and passion is what keeps me grounded and growing.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="lets-talk">
        <h2>Why We Should Talk</h2>
        <p>The Navy was one of the most important chapters of my life. My original goal was to serve in Naval Special Warfare, and while an injury shifted that path, my service taught me resilience, discipline, and leadership under pressure. I managed operations, led teams, and supported over 220 candidates every month — all with purpose and pride.</p>
        <p>Now, I bring that same work ethic into everything I do. I know that any team hiring for a role is trusting someone to solve real problems and carry real weight. I take that trust seriously. I’m not just looking for a job — I’m looking to earn my place on a team where I can contribute fully, grow continuously, and exceed expectations through consistent, hard work and accountability.</p>
        <p>If you're looking for someone who blends technical skill with humility, drive, and a deep respect for the role you're trying to fill — I’d be honored to be part of your mission.</p>
