                <h1>Hey There! I’m Jacob King.</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm currently navigating the intriguing world of computer science at Ball State University and blending it with my knack for connecting with people. Think of me as part geek, part people-person, all rolled into one.</p>

                <h2>What's My Story?</h2>
                <p>Well, I’m glad you asked! I'm on track to grab my Bachelor's in Computer Science by May 2025, and I'm pretty stoked about it. So far, I've managed to keep my GPA at a cool 3.857, which I think is not too shabby.</p>

            <section id="skills">
                <h2>What Can I Do?</h2>
                <p>I’ve got a solid grip on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
                    <li>The Cool Stuff: Flutter/Dart, Java, and Python</li>
                    <li>The Essentials: GitHub</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And I’m also dabbling in SQL, Assembly, and C when the mood strikes.</p>

                <h2>Projects I’ve Rocked</h2>
                <p><strong>Spotify Search Engine:</strong> This was my baby. Leading the project, I got to dive deep into the Spotify API, pulling out all sorts of tricks to make our app user-friendly and downright awesome. It was a crash course in Flutter/Dart, team collaboration, and keeping our code clean and tidy.</p>

                <h2>Where I've Been</h2>
                <p>My journey’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. From managing teams in the Navy and navigating the high seas of B2B sales at Impact Networking to steering the ship at Verizon Wireless, it's all been about making those human connections.</p>
                <p>And why sales, you ask? It’s simple, really. There’s something magical about that moment when you help someone find exactly what they need. Plus, making people smile is kind of my thing.</p>

                    <h2>Off the Clock</h2>
                    <p>Life at home is a bustling, heartwarming affair, filled with love from my four dogs, two cats, and most importantly, my one-year-old son, Asher. Asher has brought an indescribable joy into our lives, making every moment precious. Being a father is undoubtedly the best thing that has ever happened to me. My wife, Nataleigh, and I cherish the laughter, love, and even the chaos that comes with our little big family. When I'm not basking in the joys of family life, you might find me riding motorcycles, creating tunes, capturing life's moments through film and photography, or embracing the great outdoors. The balance between my passions and family life is what keeps me grounded and continuously striving for growth.</p>

                <h2>Why We Should Talk</h2>
                <p>Life's thrown me some curveballs — like that time I aimed to join Naval Special Warfare, only to have plans changed by an injury. But hey, it taught me discipline, the real meaning of effort, and that success comes from what you put in.</p>
                <p>I'm all about growth, purpose, and, most importantly, people. If you're looking for someone who's as passionate about tech as they are about making genuine connections, let's chat. Your stories inspire me, and I'm keen to learn, share, and grow together.</p>
